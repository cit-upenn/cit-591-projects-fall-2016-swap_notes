Swap Notes: PDF Summarizer

Swap Notes creates an abridged version of a PDF file based on user input. 
The application uses linear search to go through the PDF document and filter pages that contain keywords given by the user. 
It then represents each page as a vector using hash maps containing key-value pairs of each word and their relative frequency.
Depending on user input, the application can sort the result pages by their original order or the order of relevance to the keywords.
The document is abridged to a length as specified by the user and saved as a PDF file.
